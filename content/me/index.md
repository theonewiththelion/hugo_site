### Hi Team, Welcome to my bio:

### This is Me:
[![1649348911385.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/3wpywcxF/1649348911385.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/p9WVGk8m)

### I am 
a Senior Consultant at EY, with experience in SAP Implementation, Master Data Governance and Data Migrations. As of right now I am interested in building skills as a Data Engineer. My background in MDG implementation fueled the desire to make data available to everyone in the company (Other Data Engineers, Data Analyst, and Data science teams). I consider myself a fast learner and a go getter.

I have worked on multiple roles like: Database administrator, Business Analyst, SAP Analyst, MDG Analyst, Call Center Representative, Data Migration Analyst, SAP Master Data and Reporting Analyst, and Data Governance Consultant, but my true passion lies in Data Engineering. I also worked on multiple industries like: Insurance, Automotive, Chemicals, Technology & Automotive aftermarket parts provider.

I believe that communication and a cooperative environment in the workplace is key to success. In my free time I enjoy gaming, working out, playing tennis, and trying all the coffee shops here in Austin, Tx.
